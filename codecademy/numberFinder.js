// PRIME NUMBER FINDER
// Prime Number Finder
// Create a primeFinder() function that takes in a number, n, and returns all the prime numbers from 1 to n (inclusive). As a reminder, a prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

// For example, primeFinder(11) should return [2, 3, 5, 7, 11].

function primeFinder(n) {
    // Write your code here
